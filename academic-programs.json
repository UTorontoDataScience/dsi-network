Computers are quite remarkable electronic devices, but even more remarkable is what they can be made to do: simulate the flow of air over a wing, manage communication over the Internet, control the actions of a robot, synthesize realistic images, play grandmaster-level chess, and on and on. Indeed the application of computers in activities like these has affected most areas of modern life. What these tasks have in common has little to do with the physics or electronics of computers; what matters is that they can be formulated as some sort of computation. This is the real subject matter of Computer Science: computation, and what can or cannot be done computationally.\n\nIn trying to make sense of what we can get a computer to do, a wide variety of topics come up. There are, however, two recurring themes. The first is the issue of scale: how big a system can we specify without getting lost in the design, or how big a task can a computer handle within reasonable bounds of time, memory, and accuracy. A large part of Computer Science deals with these questions in one form or another. In the area of programming languages and methodology, for example, we look for notations for describing computations, and programming methodologies that facilitate the production of manageable and efficient software. In the theory of computation area, we study resource requirements in time and memory of many basic computational tasks.\n\nThe second theme concerns the scope of computation. Computers were originally conceived as purely numerical calculators, but today, we tend to view them much more broadly. Part of Computer Science is concerned with understanding just how far computational ideas can be applied. In the area of artificial intelligence, for example, we ask how much of the intelligent behaviour of people can be expressed in computational terms. In the area of human-computer interaction, we ask what sorts of normal day-to-day activities of people might be supported and augmented using computers.\n\nThose in the Computer Science Specialist program in the Faculty of Arts & Science may pursue an optional Focus in: Artificial Intelligence, Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, or Theory of Computation.\n","audience":"Students","key_words_tags":null,"url":"https:\/\/artsci.calendar.utoronto.ca\/program\/asspe1689","alt_links":null,"year_established":null,"date_if_event_":null,"questions":null,"hl_response":null},{"campus":"Mississauga Campus","division":"University of Toronto Mississauga","unit":"Department of Computer and Mathematical Sciences","program":"Computer Science Specialist","short_program":null,"type_education":"Yes","subtype_education":"Undergraduate Program","work_integrated_learning_experience":"No","type_research":"No","subtype_research":null,"type_resource":"No","resource_subtype_database":null,"resource_substype_infrastructure":null,"resource_subtype_service":null,"resource_subtype_software":null,"resource_subtype_training":null,"type_event_removed":null,"degree_designation":"Honours Bachelor of Science","short_description":"Computer science is concerned in the broadest sense with the study of computation and applications of computing.
